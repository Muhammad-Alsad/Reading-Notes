# DataStructures And Algrithms



## RECURSION:
 - A function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion 
 - Used in Many Algorithms is building blocks 
 - Breaking the problem in Two ways :   
    #####  Base Case
    #####  Recursive case

 - Wheres the function called it self 
 - Used When it makes the solution clearer 

## Data Structure 

 - No data structure is perfect, each one has it's uses
 - theres some mearsure to see how good is the data structure:
    ##### add()
    ##### get()
    ##### sort()
    ##### searching()
     ### All the measure above We call it Big O!!

------
### Types of Data-structure :

#### Linked List 
    - Have node and this node have a pointers that pointer connect to next node 

#### Arrays 
    - its continous blocks of cells in the computer memory 

#### Hash Table {}
    - its called object in JS 
    - its called dictionary in python 

#### Stake + Queue 
    - stack ---->  Last in first Out 
    - Add item in Used Push()
    - Remove item used Pop()
    #### Note:
     - Stack is also super important for an Algorithm called depth-First-Search


#### Graph and Trees 
    - Graph is Similar to link-list have nodes that are pointing to other excpt the pointer called edge !

    - We can use them to represent a tree family or html tree  Or binary search tree 

 
 # Discussion Questions
    -  1. depends on the specific problem's requirements Analyzing these problem's  will help you select the most suitable data structure

    - 2.   By sitting a Base case and right condition to stop the inifinte loop!!
