    - Using a Django Custom User Model offers several key benefits and advantages over the default Django User Model
    - Flexibility
    - Extensibility
    - Security
    - Data consistency
    - Integration with third-party authentication
    - Separation of concerns



#### Explain the process of creating and implementing a Custom User Model in Django, including the necessary changes to settings.py and the required model fields.
    - Create a new Django app for the custom user model

    - python manage.py startapp custom_users

    -  Update settings.py to use the Custom User Model

#### What is DjangoX and how does it complement or extend the functionality of Django? Provide an example use case for incorporating DjangoX in a project.

    -  DjangoX may include pre-designed templates and static files that are responsive and visually appealing, providing a solid foundation for building frontend components.

    - Some DjangoX templates come with Docker support, making it easier to set up and manage the development environment, especially when working with teams.

    -  Instead of creating the project from scratch, you decide to use DjangoX to speed up the development process and take advantage of its additional features.
