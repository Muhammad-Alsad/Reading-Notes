####  Intro to Hash Tables
    - Hash tables are fundamental data structures used in computer science and programming to efficiently store and retrieve data. They provide a way to map keys to values, making data retrieval fast and effective. Hash tables are also known as hash maps



#### what is a hash table?
    -  hash table is like a collection of buckets or slots, where each slot can hold a key-value pair. To store or retrieve a value associated with a given key, the hash function computes the hash code of the key

    - The process of converting keys into array indices using a hash function is called hashing. A good hash function should distribute the keys uniformly across the array

    - hash tables have strategies to handle them, such as chaining or open addressing.
