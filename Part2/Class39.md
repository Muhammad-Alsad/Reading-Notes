#### What is React Context, and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application?

    - React Context is a feature provided by the React library that allows you to manage state and share data between components in a more efficient and convenient way. It addresses the problem of prop drilling, which occurs when you have to pass data through multiple levels of components just to get it to a deeply nested component that needs it


    - Context provides a way to avoid this by allowing you to create a centralized place where certain data can be stored and accessed by any component in the component tree without needing to pass it explicitly through props.


####   Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component.
    

    -  The useContext hook is a built-in React hook that provides a simple and elegant way to access data from a React Context within a functional component. It eliminates the need to use the Consumer component and the render prop pattern, making the code cleaner and more concise.

    - import React, { useContext } from 'react';


#### Describe the purpose of Next.js, and provide an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples reading on how it can be used to build a scalable web application.

    - Next.js is a popular React framework that is designed to simplify and enhance the process of building server-rendered React applications.

    - It provides a set of tools and features that make it easier to create performant, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications

    - Some of its main features include server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), routing, and automatic code splitting.


     -  It handles routing, server-side rendering, and static site generation with relatively minimal code, allowing developers to focus on building features and user interfaces
