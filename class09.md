#### In the video “AI Guru makes $238,800 with misleading paid course,” what was the main ethical issue raised concerning the use of developers’ work, and how might this have been avoided?
    - In the video "AI Guru makes $238,800 with misleading paid course," the main ethical issue raised was the use of developers' work without their permission or proper attribution.
    
   

    - Alternatively, the AI guru could have developed his own original code and content for the course, rather than relying on others' work. While this may have required more time and effort, it would have been a more ethical and legitimate approach to creating and selling a paid course.

    -  The AI guru in question was accused of copying code from open source repositories and incorporating it into his paid course without giving credit to the original developers.

    - This type of behavior is not only unethical, but it also violates the principles of intellectual property and could potentially lead to legal consequences. 

    - To avoid this issue, the AI guru could have taken a more ethical approach by properly crediting the original developers and obtaining permission to use their code. This could have been done by including a list of references or acknowledgments in the course materials or by contacting the original developers directly to request permission.
