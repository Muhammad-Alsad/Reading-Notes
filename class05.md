## Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency
    - Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency
    - Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors:

    - Running Time
    - Memory Space    

### tHERE'S  4 Key Areas for analysis:
    - Input Size
    - Units of Measurement
    - Orders of Growth
    - Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case

## Linked Lists
    - A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.
    -  A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.
    -  Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.        


## Asymptotic Notations
    - Big O(oh): Worst Case
    - Big Omega : Best Case
    - Best Case:  Average Case


## Summary 

    - Big O: The worst case analysis of algorithm efficiency.
    - Running Time: The amount of time required for an algorithm to complete.
    - Memory Space: The amount of memory resources required for an algorithm to complete.
    - Input Size: Represented by the variable n, the total size of values used as parameters in an algorithm.
    - Big Omega: The best case analysis of algorithm efficiency.
    - Big Theta: The typical or random case used for analysis of algorithm efficiency.
