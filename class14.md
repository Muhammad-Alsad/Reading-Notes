## Data Visualization

#### What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.
    - Matplotlib: is a versatile plotting library that provides a wide range of plotting functions and supports various types of plots, including line plots

    - Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for creating attractive statistical visualizations.

    - Bokeh:  is a powerful library for interactive and browser-based visualizations.
    It is designed to create interactive plots that can be easily shared and explored in web applications or notebooks.

#### In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case.

    - Relational Plots: 
        scatterplot(): This function creates a scatter plot, showing the relationship between two variables.
        lineplot(): This function creates a line plot, useful for showing the trend or change in a variable over time or another continuous dimension.
        
    - Categorical Plots:
         barplot(): This function creates a bar plot, commonly used to compare the values of a categorical variable.
         countplot(): This function creates a count plot, which displays the count of occurrences of each category in a categorical variable.
