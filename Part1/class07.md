#### Explain the concept of variable scope in Python and describe the difference between local and global scope. Provide an example illustrating the usage of both.
 - Local scope: A variable defined within a function has local scope and can only be accessed within that function
 - Global scope: A variable defined outside of a function has global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the program


#### How do the global and nonlocal keywords work in Python, and in what situations might you use them?
    - The global keyword is used inside a function to declare a variable as global
    - If a variable is not declared as global inside a function, Python will assume that it is a local variable.

#### In your own words, describe the purpose and importance of Big O notation in the context of algorithm analysis.
    - The purpose of Big O notation is to express the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size of the input data
    -  Big O notation is a mathematical concept used to describe the performance of algorithms
    - Is to provide a standardized way to compare the efficiency of different algorithms

#### Based on the Rolling Dice Example, explain how you would simulate a dice roll using Python. Describe how you would use code to calculate the probability of rolling a specific number (e.g., the probability of rolling a 6) over a large number of trials
    - Simulate rolling a 6 over 10,000 trials by looping
