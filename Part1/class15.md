# Class 15

## Trees

### we will learn Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and K-ary Trees

- Node 
- Root 
- K
- Left
- Right
- Edge
- Leaf
- Height

#### Use an analogy:
     - An analogy for a tree data structure could be comparing it to a family tree. Just like a family tree has a hierarchical structure with a root ancestor and branches representing generations, a tree data structure has a root node and child nodes that branch out

#### Explain a detail in depth:
    - A tree data structure is a hierarchical data structure where each node (except the root) has a parent node and zero or more child nodes

####  Use WHY, WHAT, HOW structure:   
    - WHY: Explain why tree data structures are useful in computer science and programming. 
    - WHAT: Define what a tree data structure is, its components
    - HOW: Discuss how to implement and traverse a tree, covering methods like depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).

#### Tutorial / walk through an example:
    -  Tutorial example: Create a binary search tree from a list of numbers.
    - Start with an empty tree.

    - Take the first number from the list and make it the root of the tree.

    - For each subsequent number, compare it with the root and place it as the left child if it's smaller or the right child if it's larger.

    -Repeat this process for all the numbers, maintaining the binary search tree property.

    - Finally, you will have a binary search tree that can be used for efficient searching or sorting operations.

####  Write a quiz:
    - Quiz question: Which of the following data structures represents a hierarchical relationship?
    A) Array
    B) Linked List
    C) Tree
    D) Stack
