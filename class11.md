#### What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it differ from Jupyter Notebook?
    - Both popular tools for interactive computing and data exploration
    - Jupyter Lab offers some additional features and benefits compared to Jupyter Notebook.
    - Jupyter Lab provides a more flexible and extensible user interface compared to Jupyter Notebook
    - Jupyter Lab introduces an MDI, which means you can have multiple notebooks, code editors, or other files open simultaneously within different tabs or side by side

    
#### What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?
    - Numerical Python is a powerful library in Python that provides functionality for efficient numerical computations and array manipulation 
    - Efficient Element-Wise Operations
    - N-dimensional Array Objects
    - Array Broadcasting
    - Array Indexing and Slicing
    - Memory Optimization

#### Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.
    - NumPy arrays, represented by the ndarray object, are the fundamental data structure in the NumPy library
    - Creating an array from a Python list:
      python :- 
        import numpy as np
        arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    - Creating an array of zeros or ones:
        zeros = np.zeros(5)    
    - Shape: NumPy arrays have a fixed shape, represented by a tuple of integers that specify the size of each dimension.
       ex:- arr.shape
